# Working with Tables and `xtable`

## Alan Arnholt

Suppose we have some results we would like to display in a table such as
the results from the following code chunk:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment = NA}
library(PASWR)
T1 <- xtabs(~Treatment + Ease, data = EPIDURALf)
T1
```

To create a Table with `xtable`, first load the `xtable` package.

```{r results ='asis'}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(T1, caption = "Table 1: Treatment versus Ease"), type = 'html')
```

```{r}
tapply(EPIDURALf$kg, list(EPIDURALf$Ease, EPIDURALf$Doctor), mean)
```


```{r results ='asis', echo = FALSE}
print(xtable(tapply(EPIDURALf$kg, list(EPIDURALf$Ease, EPIDURALf$Doctor), mean), caption = "Table 2: Put Something Here"), type = 'html')
```
