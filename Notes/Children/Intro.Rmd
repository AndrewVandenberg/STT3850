Most of the material in the notes is taken from the class text _Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and `R`_ by Laura Chihara and Tim Hesterberg with slight modifications.  Some material in the notes is also taken from the first chapter of _Practicing Statistics: Guided Investigations for the Second Course_ by Shonda Kuiper and Jeffrey Sklar.  There are a number of places to get help with `R`.  The class text has some material online at: [https://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/rtutorials](https://sites.google.com/site/chiharahesterberg/rtutorials).
