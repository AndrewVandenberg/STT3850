# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Consider Table \@ref(tab:cars).

```{r label = "cars", echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), booktabs = TRUE,
             caption = 'First six rows of `mtcars`')
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots such as Figure \@ref(fig:pressure).

```{r label = "pressure", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of `pressure` versus `temperature`",fig.align = "center"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Inline `R` Code

```{r}
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
library(tidyverse)
SI <- mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarize(Mean = mean(qsec), SD = sd(qsec))
SI
```
The mean `qsec` time for six cylinder cars is `r round(SI[2, 2],2)` seconds.

# Chi-Square Test?

Two different professors teach an introductory statistics course. Table \@ref(tab:TP) shows the distribution of final grades they reported. We wonder whether one of these professors is an "easier" grader.

```{r, label = "TP", echo = FALSE}
mat <- matrix(data = c(3, 10, 11, 11, 14, 8, 10, 1, 4, 0), nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)
dimnames(mat) <- list(Grade = c("A","B","C","D","F"), Professor = c("Alpha", "Beta"))
tt <- as.table(mat)
knitr::kable(tt, caption = "Grades for Alpha and Beta")
```

* Will you test goodness-of-fit, **homogeneity**, or independence?

*  Write the appropriate hypotheses.

$H_0:$ The distribution of grades is the same for the two professors. $H_A:$ The distribution of grades is different for the two professors.

* Find the expected counts for each cell.

```{r}
chisq.test(tt)$exp
```

* Explain why the chi-square procedures are not appropriate for this table. **Since some of the cells have expected counts less than 5, the chi-square procedures are not appropriate.**

* Solution---Permutation

## Make `tt` tidy

```{r}
ttt <- tt %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  uncount(n)
ttt
```

## Using `infer`

```{r}
T1 <- xtabs(~Grade + Professor, data = ttt)
obs_stat <- chisq.test(T1)$stat
obs_stat
library(infer)
null <- ttt %>% 
  specify(Grade ~ Professor) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 999, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")
visualize(null, method = "both")
get_pvalue(null, obs_stat, direction = "right")
(pvalue <- (sum(null$stat >= obs_stat) + 1)/(999 + 1))
```

## Using a `for()` loop

Figure \@ref(fig:appcom) shows the theoretical $\chi^2_4$ distribution in blue, while the permutation distribution from using computation is shown as the pink density.

```{r}
sims <- 10^3 - 1
x2 <- numeric(sims)
for(i in 1:sims){
  TT <- xtabs(~Grade + sample(Professor), data = ttt)
  x2[i] <- chisq.test(TT)$stat
}
pvalue <- (sum(x2 >= obs_stat) + 1)/(sims + 1)
pvalue
```

```{r, label = "appcom", fig.cap = "Theoretical and computation null distribution"}
DF <- data.frame(x = x2)
ggplot(data = DF, aes(x = x)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "pink", alpha = 0.3) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = 4), color = "blue") 
```
