# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Consider Table \@ref(tab:cars).

```{r label = "cars", echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), booktabs = TRUE,
             caption = 'First six rows of `mtcars`')
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots such as Figure \@ref(fig:pressure).

```{r label = "pressure", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of `pressure` versus `temperature`",fig.align = "center"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Inline `R` Code

```{r}
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
library(tidyverse)
SI <- mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarize(Mean = mean(qsec), SD = sd(qsec))
SI
```
The mean `qsec` time for six cylinder cars is `r round(SI[2, 2],2)` seconds.
