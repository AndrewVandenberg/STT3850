## Read in data

* Download the file `TMP.xlsx` https://github.com/alanarnholt/STT3850/blob/gh-pages/Data/TMP.xlsx and upload it to your account.  Use the package `readxl` along with the function `read_excel()` to read the excel spreadsheet into an R object named `DF`.

* Find and fix the problem(s) with the variable `Age_Cohort`.

*  What is the average of expenditures for: (a) all males, (b) all Hispanics, (c) all 22-50 year olds, (d) all male, White non-Hispanics, and (e) all Asian, 22-50 year olds? 

* Use `ggplot2` to create appropriate barplots for all of the answers in the previous bullet.

#### Consider only "White" and "Hispanic" ethnicities for the remainder of the exercise.

* Why do you think the average expenditures for Hispanics and Whites are so different?  Is this evidence of discrimination?
