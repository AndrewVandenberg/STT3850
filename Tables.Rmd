# Working with Tables and `xtable`

## Alan Arnholt

Suppose we have some results we would like to display in a table such as
the results from the following code chunk:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment = NA}
library(PASWR)
T1 <- xtabs(~Treatment + Ease, data = EPIDURALf)
T1
```

To create a Table with a caption, we need first to load the `xtable` package.

```{r results ='asis'}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(T1, caption = "You put something here"), type = 'html')
```
